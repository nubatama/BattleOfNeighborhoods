    "Since the spring of this year, COVID-19 has been damaged in many countries around the world. A COVID-19 cluster has also occurred in Shinjuku (Tokyo), Japan. Although it has stopped for a while, cluster formation has been confirmed again this month.  \n",
    "Shinjuku is a city where various businesses are actively conducted. Even if you know that a cluster has occurred, we still need to do business activities. Even in Shinjuku, it is reported that clusters are occurring in some areas (around Kabukicho).  \n",

    "Is it possible to avoid the risk of COVID-19?  \n",
